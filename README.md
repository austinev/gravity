# gravity

This is a little exercise I wanted to do to just do some meaningful animation in html.  The ball is set to absolute positioning, and the JS just updates the x,y styling.  Upon starting, a regular clock tick determines the new positions based on the "acceleration" of gravity.   If the ball is bouncing, the velocity is reversed and some friction occurs.  The sideways vector is not affected by gravity, but also has some small friction so the ball will come to a halt.
